# JavaScript Variables Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice using const and let to declare variables in JavaScript

## Instructions

We've covered a lot of JavaScript concepts, but now it's time to put the
concepts into practice. We'll start with variables.

### Mocha Tests:

- Mocha tests have been provided to ensure the accuracy of your solution
- In your terminal, once inside the lab folder, run in order:
    - `npm install` to install all the packages contained in the package.json
    - `npm test` to execute the tests and check whether your variables match the expectations


### Structure

The structure of this lab — where its files and folders are located — looks
roughly like the following:

```txt
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── index.js
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
└── test
    └── indexTest.js
```

All labs will more or less have the same structure. (And non-lab lessons, for
that matter, will still have CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, and README.md files.)


### Instructions

1. **`organizationName`**:
   - Declare a variable named `organizationName` and set it equal to `"Acme Corp"`.
   - Use the `const` keyword to declare `organizationName`.

2. **`mostLucrativeDistrict`**:
   - Declare a variable named `mostLucrativeDistrict` and set it equal to `"Downtown"`.
   - Use the `let` keyword to declare `mostLucrativeDistrict`.

3. **`CEO`**:
   - Declare a variable named `CEO` and set it equal to `"John Doe"`.
   - Use the `let` keyword to declare `CEO`.

4. **Data Type Exploration**:
   - Declare variables with the following names using the `let` keyword:
     - `stringVar`: Set it to the string `"Welcome"`.
     - `numberVar`: Set it to the number `100`.
     - `booleanVar`: Set it to the boolean value `false`.
     - `nullVar`: Set it to `null`.
     - `undefinedVar`: Declare it without assigning a value.

5. **Array Creation**:
   - Declare a variable named `myArray` using `const` and assign it an array containing at least three elements of different data types. **Ensure each element in the array is of a different data type**.

6. **Object Creation**:
   - Declare a variable named `myObject` using `const` and assign it an object with at least three key-value pairs. You have complete freedom to choose the keys and values.

7. **Variable Reassignment**:
   - Reassign the new value of "Hell's Kitchen" to `mostLucrativeDistrict`.
